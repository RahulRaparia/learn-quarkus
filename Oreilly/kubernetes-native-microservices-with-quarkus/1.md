# 1. Introduction to Quarkus, MicroProfile, and Kubernetes
A “runtime” is an execution environment that includes a collection of packaged frameworks that collectively support a developer’s application logic. Java EE (now Jakarta EE [https://jakarta.ee/]) application servers, Spring Boot, and Quarkus are all examples of Java runtimes: each is a Java execution environment with Java frameworks that support application logic.
## what is microservice
As defined in Enterprise Java Microservices (https://livebook.manning.com/book/enterprise-java-microservices), a microservice consists of a single deployment executing within a single process, isolated from other deployments and processes, that supports the fulfillment of a specific piece of business functionality.

With Kubernetes as the target deployment platform, we have an opportunity for optimizing code and the Java runtime itself. Although a microservice is isolated business functionality, it nearly always interacts with other microservices

First, a microservice implements a specific piece of business functionality, known as a bounded context (as explained by Eric Evans; https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215), which is a logical separation of multiple business problem domains within an enterprise. By logically breaking down a business domain into multiple bounded contexts, each bounded context more accurately represents its specific view of the business domain and becomes easier to model.
